# Video-to-Text
video to text... is what this program does...

I may change this frame work to include a dx11 video output along with multicore workload processing

This program REALLY LOVES AVX - having AVX will make processing time next to none [This was experimented on, but not pushed to main branch - mainly since I am working on some other project of greater importance - auto vectorization by the compiler does seem to happen]


This program takes advantage of a pagefile and having more ram greatly as well - so yeah...
